## SensorWrite App
UMKC, Summer 2014

This application uses the TI SensorTag to record the gestures of the user. Recorded gestures can be classified with machine learning to recognize future gestures. Accordingly, the user "air-writes" letters to an Android display using the TI SensorTag's accelerometer, and they are received and recognized after training has completed.
